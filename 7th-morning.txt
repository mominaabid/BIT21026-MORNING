                                  Computer vision final project:
                                    Facial emotion detection
This project is a **Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection System** that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
for recognizing human emotions from facial expressions. The system is trained on a dataset organized into directories for training and testing
 (e.g., the FER-2013 dataset). The training process employs data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, and horizontal flipping to 
enhance model performance. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dense layers to extract features and 
classify them into one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

The project leverages **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model development, **OpenCV** for real-time video processing and face detection using 
Haar Cascade Classifiers, and **NumPy** for numerical computations. The trained model is saved as `emotion_model.h5` and can be deployed in real-time
 using a webcam. The real-time detection process captures video frames, detects faces, preprocesses them (grayscale conversion and resizing),
 predicts emotions using the trained model, and overlays the identified emotion on the video feed. This project is an integration of machine learning,
 computer vision, and deep learning technologies to achieve efficient emotion recognition in real-time applications.
